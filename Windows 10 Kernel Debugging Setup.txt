1. Power on Windows 10 VM. Copy VirtualKD-3.0 folder to the VM's desktop.
2. Open VirtualKD-3.0 and then browse to target
3. Run vminstall.exe program located in this directory. Accept the defaults, click past the first warning, and click No on the reboot message that appears after this.
4. Browse to VirtualKD-3.0/target/x86/ or VirtualKD-3.0/target/x64/ (depending on target architecture of Windows 10 host) 
and copy kdbazis.dll and kdpatch.sys to C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\. You will need to click Yes on the UAC warning as you need admin privs to
copy to this folder.
5. Go back to VirtualKD-3.0/target/ and run kdpatch as admin by double clicking on it and clicking Yes on the UAC prompt and then Yes on the warning that this will change settings.
6. Open CMD.exe as admin.
7. Enter the following commands:
      1. bcdedit /debug on
      2. bcdedit /dbgsettings serial debugport:1 baudrate:115200
8. Reboot your computer.
9. Open vmmon64.exe or vmmon.exe on your host.
10. Use the arrow keys to move between boot menu selections and get it so it is pointed to "Disable Signature Enforcement Manually!" or the entry similar to this one.
11. DON'T CLICK ENTER. Instead click F8 whilst hovered over this entry and then scroll down to the option labeled "Disable Driver Signature Enforcement" and hit ENTER.
12. Windows should now boot and send a message to VirtualKD which should now load up WinDbg with the correct settings and drop you into a nice shell.


This has been tested to work on all Windows 10 versions I have encountered so far, including insider releases.
