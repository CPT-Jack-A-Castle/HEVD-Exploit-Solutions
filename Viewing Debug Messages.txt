So apparently if your debugging a target in kernel debugging mode and the guest is Windows Vista+, DbgPrint is mapped to DbgPrintEx, which allows one to "control the conditions under which messages will be sent to the kernel debugger by filtering messages via a component name and level in the function call and an associated filter mask in either the registry or in memory." (http://www.osronline.com/article.cfm?article=295) 

According to http://www.osronline.com/article.cfm?article=295, one can fix this via two methods. The method I tried was to create the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Debug Print Filter and create a REG_DWORD underneath this called DEFAULT which I set to a value of 0xF to view all debug output.

Here is to hoping this works....update to come.
